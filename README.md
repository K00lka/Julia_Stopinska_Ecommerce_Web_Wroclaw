About:

The project uses following CSS libraries:
1. Tailwind 
2. React-bootstrap

Pages:
    Cart -> Koszyk
    Marketplace -> Main
    Summary -> Podsumowanie
    Confirmation -> Potwierdzenie

Features:
    - adding and removing items from a cart
    - clearing cart after confirming a purhcase
    - Navigating between sections by React Router

Problems:
I was not sure what was ment by reloading wit new HTML. I thought the task creator might've ment new URL and reloading so I did it this way (you can find explanation in a comment in "Summary.tsx")

I would definetely improve visual aspects if I only had more time as some components are pretty... raw.
